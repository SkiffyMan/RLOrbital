Orbital is a GUI for MarlBot. All it does is pass arguments through to marlbot in a GUI Form.
All Credits to MarlBurrow for the bot.

⚠️⚠️⚠️ RLMarlbot is designed to facilitate the use of bots in private matches with your friends without the need for RLBot. It should be used primarily for testing and debugging by botmakers. However, this tool employs advanced reverse engineering techniques that could legitimately be considered cheating by the game's standards. I strongly advise against using RLMarlbot in ranked or casual matches. Your Rocket League account is likely to be banned quickly if you violate this rule.
  
How to use?
Step 1:
Extract Winrar
Step 2:
Run RLOrbital.exe
Step 3:
Select Process and Arguments
Step 4:
Press start bot
step 5: 
Press F1 in game.

If you need multiple Instances there is a launcher included that allows for this. In this case, launch your main instance natively on your PC first before using the Integrated Launcher. 
For more than 1 instance, press add account, and after you have launched, press delete. Repeat Until you have all the Rocket League processes that you want.


[!] I have very little time to allocate to this project, hence the obviously rushed code and basic GUI. This is basically a Proof of Concept and perhaps inspiration for people to make something more advanced. [!]
