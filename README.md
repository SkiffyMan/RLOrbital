Orbital
==================

An Unofficial GUI tool for managing multiple instances of MarlBot, designed as an all-in-one solution for botmakers.

**Version 1.0.9**

⚠️ Warning: RLMarlbot is intended for testing and debugging purposes only. Using it in ranked or casual matches may result in account bans.


1. Extract the WinRAR archive.
2. Place MarlBot.exe in the directory as "Bot.exe".
3. Run RLOrbital.exe.
4. Select Process and Arguments.
5. Press Start Bot (this may take a while).
6. Press Toggle Key In-game (default is F1).

**Using the Launcher**

To ensure the launcher works correctly, you need to follow these steps:

1. Make sure the rocket league directory you select is the correct directory. For example: D:\Username\Epic Games\rocketleague
2. I recommend disabling 2FA on your Epic Account. You can still use 2FA if needed, but be aware it will lead to having to re-sign into your accounts much more often than without.


[!] I have limited time to dedicate to this project, which means the code and GUI are still in their early stages. [!]
